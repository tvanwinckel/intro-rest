# Creating a REST server application

Goal of this exercise is to create a server application providing a REST interface. Given is an example [project](https://github.com/tvanwinckel/intro-rest/tree/main/springREST "REST-Server") that provides a basic application with a few services. 

* Create a controller class for each service and its functions to provide simple CRUD opperations. Make these controlles confirm with the constraints that define REST.
* Provide the correct error/exception handling where needed.
* Allow resources to be partially updated.
* Provide additional functionallity like a 'search' function on these controller.
* Update your API by creating a 'breaking' change, requiring a version update. Provide both the new and previous API's.
