# Creating a REST client application

Goal of this exercise is to create a client application consuming a REST interface. For this we'll need to create a new (Spring) application.

* Create a client allowing you to consume the REST api you created in the server exercise. Or any other REST api that you would like to consume. 
* Make sure you can handle both expected and unexpecte responses.
* If you are feeling adeventurous try to experiment with both he old RestTemplate and new WebClient classes.
